# Jazzy

**Jazzy** is an AI-enhanced JS/PHP framework designed for automatic A/B testing of your design solutions.

We have built a regression model that analyzes how small changes to specific elements on your website impact conversion rates, providing actionable recommendations on how to optimize your website's KPIs.

### How It Works

1. **Select Parameters**: Choose which elements and parameters you want to analyze.
2. **Data Collection**: Jazzy collects data for the model by making slight adjustments to these parameters each time a new user visits your website.
3. **Model Optimization**: The model optimizes for convergence, offering practical insights into how to make your website more effective and profitable.

### Advanced Features

If you gather enough data, you can even allow the model to automatically update your website, simplifying the iteration process on the frontend.

### Privacy & Control

Jazzy's lightweight model allows you to run all analytics on your own server, ensuring full control over your data without sharing it with third parties.

### Try It Out

Install PHP, Apache, and MySQL, then run `index.php` to explore this demo web application and see how Jazzy can transform your website optimization process.
